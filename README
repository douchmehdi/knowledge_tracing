This repository aims to compare the performance of different Knowledge-Tracing
methods (AFM-BG, AFG-BGT & PFA) on a RoboMission dataset.

It contains the following files:
    - run_experiments.py
        script allowing to fit the KC models and compute metrics
    - test_run_experiment.py
        some unit-test to make sure that encoding for different methods are ok
    - plot_experiments.py
        dirty script to plot the results from differents experiments files

RoboMission files should be added to the folder data/RoboMission
